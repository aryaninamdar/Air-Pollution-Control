# Air Pollution Control
A computer-vision algorithm which mitigates the pollution in a given region by predicting the number of trees that should be afforested in specific areas.

## Retreiving Suitable Satelite Images for a Given Region
The user is prompted to input the name of the area, on which the program has to be executed. The satellite images of that area will be scraped and are zoomed as such to generate a clear image of the map on which image segmentation can be performed.

## Identifiying Available Spaces for Tree Afforestation
This process uses a **3 part computer-vision algorithm** to find the areas fit for afforestation (i.e. areas without any buildings, roads, etc.):

### Segmentation of the Satelite Imagery
The satellite image generated by the 1st step undergoes **semantic segmentation**, which segregates all distinct objects in the image. The said image is then divided into objects such as buildings, trees, water bodies, roads, barren land etc.. The first algorithm of choice is **Mean Shift Algorithm** for segmentation.

### Object "Feature Extraction" Using Zernike Moments
**Zernike moments** are powerful region-based shape descriptors that are invariant against linear transformations and especially against object boundary deformation. For each of the segments generated by Segmentation algorithm, Zernike moments are calculated and stored.

### Classification
In this process of classification, we need to train a **Classifier** which can identify the buildings, trees, and most importantly, the free land. The Zernike moments used by the above method will be used as features for these segments. The classifier is trained with labels as **'buildings', 'trees', 'water', 'free land', and 'roads'**. After the training , we simply need to find the results coming from the 'Free Land' label. Thus, we are enabled to find the number of trees needed to be planted in these areas with free land in order to bring the given region's air pollution levels back to normal.
