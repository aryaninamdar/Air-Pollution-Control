# Air Pollution Control
A computer-vision algorithm which mitigates the pollution in a given region by predicting the number of trees that should be afforested in specific areas.

## Retreiving Suitable Satelite Images for a Given Region
The user is prompted to input the name of the area, on which the program has to be executed. The satellite images of that area will be scraped and are zoomed as such to generate a clear image of the map on which image segmentation can be performed.

## Identifiying Available Spaces for Tree Afforestation
This process uses a 3 part computer-vision algorithm to find the areas fit for afforestation (i.e. areas without any buildings, roads, etc.):

### Segmentation of the Satelite Imagery
The satellite image generated by the 1st step undergoes semantic segmentation, which segregates all distinct objects in the image. The said image is then divided into objects such as buildings, trees, water bodies, roads, barren land etc.. The first algorithm of choice is Mean Shift Algorithm for segmentation.
